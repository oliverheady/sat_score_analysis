Utilizing Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, this project employs data analysis and linear regression to explore relationships within the 2012 SAT scores, focusing on testing group sizes and average math scores. Visual insights are crafted using Matplotlib/Seaborn.


# SAT Score Analysis: Understanding the Influence of Testing Environments

## Overview

This project embarks on a journey to explore the intriguing relationship between testing environments and student performance in standardized tests, taking a closer look at the 2012 SAT scores. Stemming from the contrasting testing experiences of Oliver Heady and Christopher Harris, the analysis navigates through the data, investigating how the number of students taking the SAT test at a specific time relates to their average math scores. 

## Data

The dataset, accessible from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2012-sat-results), provides insights into the 2012 SAT scores, focusing on two pivotal variables:
- The **number of students** taking the test at a specific time
- The **average math score** of the students from that test-taking session

## Hypothesis

The hypothesis is born out of personal reflections on standardized testing experiences, considering whether the size of the testing group influences the average math scores achieved. The curiosity is rooted in two diverse scenarios:
- Chris experienced a highly individualized testing environment, taking his ACT alone with a private proctor
- Oliver, conversely, utilized online tools for preparation and took the test in a large group setting in the high school gymnasium

These distinct experiences serve as a springboard to explore whether such environmental factors hold statistical significance in influencing test outcomes.

## Methodology

The analysis employs Simple Linear Regression to delve into the relationship between the number of test-takers and average math scores, evaluating assumptions and dissecting relationships within the data. The journey of the analysis follows these steps:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Understanding the dataset and its variables
2. **Visual Exploration:** Creating scatter plots to visually inspect the potential relationships
3. **Modeling:** Building and evaluating a simple linear regression model
4. **Assumptions Check:** Ensuring the model adheres to the assumptions of linear regression
5. **Conclusion:** Drawing inferences and concluding the analysis

## Tools Used

- **Python:** The analysis is conducted using Python, leveraging its powerful libraries and tools
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** For crafting insightful visualizations
- **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating the linear regression model

## Conclusion

The project culminates by drawing conclusions from the analysis and reflecting on the initial hypothesis, exploring whether the data provides sufficient evidence to validate or refute the perceived relationship between testing environments and average math scores.
